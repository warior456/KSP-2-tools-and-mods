# Kerbal Space Program 2 Tools and Mods
### Simple list of all (currently available) tools and mods for KSP2
Stuff will almost certainly break over time, so if you find anything it'd be great to tell someone in the [modding discord](https://discord.gg/3D7Yj9SJ8n) or make a pull request fixing it

## Contributing
If you want to add/remove a mod/tool, feel free to just make a pull request or open an issue with the mod/tool name, author and link

We currently only use the readme
